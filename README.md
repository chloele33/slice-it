USER’S GUIDE

Please watch the trailer :)

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

The primary goal of the player is to survive as long as possible (by keeping the health higher than 0 and avoid colliding with a bomb) while trying to score as many goals possible. To do so, the player has to achieve the secondary, more immediate, goals of slicing the blue cubes as many times as possible to get more points, dodging the unbreakable white cubes to avoid losing health, while pushing the small ones to the side barriers to gain points, and avoiding the bombs or using them to destroy obstacles. 
The challenge of the game is trying to interact properly with all the objects coming your way while the speed increases. The conflict comes from the user having to choose the interactions to perform at each time, since sometimes you could decide to gain points at the risk of losing health or just not get those points, or decide to just get rid of the bombs vs trying to use them to destroy obstacles to reduce the amount of movement you have to do, or choosing to try to push the small unbreakable cube into the force field at the side risking getting hit by something else while being distracted and looking to the side. 
This game does not have a winning condition, since it can’t be fully won, it is simply a challenge of how long the player can survive.

CONTROLS

Right-hand (lightsaber)
Move the hand to slice through the “slizable” objects in the scene.

Left-hand (tractor beam)
Point with the laser to a bomb and then press the trigger of the left-hand controller to grab the bomb with the tractor beam so that you can throw it (moving hand + releasing the trigger) or trying to hit the obstacle cubes in the scene. 

GAME ELEMENTS

Blue cube: object you can slice as many times as possible to gain points.
Red sphere/bombs: you can grab them using the tractor beam and either throw them to the sides to destroy them or throw them against a white cube to destroy both the bomb and that cube. If a bomb hits you it will explode and it is game over.
White cubes: obstacles you have to avoid, if you are hit by one of them you will lose health. If you lose all your health it is game over.
Small white cubes: these are special white cubes that you can also push away with your lightsaber, to either stop them from hitting you or pushing them to the side force fields to gain additional points. Be careful not to get too distracted by them.
Purple diamond: a power up that, when you slice it, stops you from losing health for 10 seconds.



HOW TO SETUP AND CONFIGURE YOUR GAME:

All you need is to have is a Vive device set up so that you have a decent area to move around in but does not require it to be too big. Then just run the .exe file and in FinalBuild and you can start playing. 


GAME PLAY FEATURES

GAME APPEAL

1). Immersive gameplay: the player will have a first point of view and will be moving and interacting with the game as if the player was there.
2). Action: the game requires a lot of interaction from the user, keeping the player constantly busy with different tasks.  
4). Exercise: the player will have to be actively moving in order to achieve a good score, constantly dodging and slicing the objects around them.  
5). Practice/repatibility: the game allows for improvement, introducing the player to the different elements slowly and then increasing the pace, allowing the player to practice and to get higher scores over time. 


FEATURES/FUNCTIONALITIES

Slicing different objects (to get points or obtain a power-up)
Reading user position to check is an obstacle has been dodged
A spawner that introduces the different elements in the game one by one so the player can learn as the difficulty increases.
Futuristic look and feel
Different kinds of danger: the bombs exploding and losing health
A tractor beam that allows the player to grab the bombs and throw them
Sounds that match the movement of the lightsaber
Additional sounds for the different interactions (slicing, destroying, tractor beam, etc.)
Providing the score and health information to the user
GUI screens for the start, instructions, and game over
Bigger platform so the user is aware of where they are standing
Added force fields to the sides to restrict the user to the area and allow better immersion by having interactivity with the sides. The player can therefore push the small white cubes to the sides, trying to get them to the force fields to destroy them and get additional points.
The screen tints to red when the player is hit and to blue when the player has a power-up active. 
Power-ups that allow the user to rest for 10 seconds by not being able to get hit. 



TECHNICAL ISSUES USING THE VIVE AND UNITY
	
  At first we were trying to use the latest update of SteamVR, which had a lot of changes from the previous versions that was giving us a lot of problems and did not seem as intuitive. Once we realized it was an added difficulty, we decided to change to a previous version of SteamVR, which worked better while trying to find tutorials and information on how to work on VR.
